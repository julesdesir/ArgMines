0. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Blue carbon extraction since 1950 Between 1950 and 2014, the world's fishing fleets have extracted 318.4 million metric tons (Mt) of large fish from the ocean, equiva lent to 37.5 + 7.4 Mt of carbon (MtC) released into the atmosphere.
1. This means that fishing has prevented the sequestration of 21.8 + 4.4 MtC through the sinking of fish bodies into the deep sea, after accounting for the consumption of biomass from predation (Fig. 1A).
2. Most of this blue carbon extirpation (87.4%) is due to the fishing of Scombridae species (56.2% for tunas and 31.2% for mackerels), while shark and billfish catches represent 10.5 and 1.9% of the total, re spectively (Fig. 1B).
3. Industrial fisheries have extracted 84.8% of the total (33.6 + 6.7 MtC), while artisanal, subsistence, and recreational fisher ies have extracted 12.3% (4.9 + 0.9 MtC), 1.97% (0.8 + 0.1 MtC), and 0.9% (0.37 + 0.07 MtC), respectively (Fig. 1C).
4. The spatial distribution of fished blue carbon since 1950 reveals a marked heterogeneity with a maximum of 533 kgC per hectare extracted in the Western Pacific Ocean, while 26.5% of the ocean surface shows no blue carbon extraction.
5. The Pacific Ocean, where most tuna fisheries concentrate, accounts for 71.1% of the total blue carbon extirpated, and 49.1% takes place in the equatorial strip (i.e., between 10°S and 10°N latitude; Fig.
6. The national fishing fleets with the largest overall blue carbon extraction are based in Japan, Indonesia, and Taiwan, with 22.2, 6, and 5.1% of the total, respectively (Fig. 1E).
7. Combined with fishing fleets from the Philippines, Spain, USA, Ecuador, China, South Korea, and Thailand, these 10 countries account for 62% of total blue carbon extirpated since 1950.
8. Like any other food production sector, fishing also emits CO2 by consuming and burning fuel.
9. In the fishing sector, fuel consumption represents the majority of its carbon footprint (21).
10. Using an emission intensity factor of 1.9 metric tons of CO; emitted per metric ton of fish landed (21), we estimate that 165.3 MtC were emitted between 1950 and 2014 due to the fuel consumption needed to extract blue carbon from the ocean.
11. If we sum up large fish carbon exported (37.5 MtC) on land and the emissions due to fuel consumption (165.3 MtC; Fig.
12. , then we obtain a total of 0.2 GtC emitted in the atmosphere since 1950 by fisheries, equivalent to 0.73 GtCO>.
13. Mariani et al., Sci. Adv. 2020; 6: eabb4848 28 October 2020 Spatiotemporal dynamics of blue carbon extraction Total blue carbon extraction from the ocean has increased steadily since 1950 (Fig. 2A).
14. In 2014, fisheries extracted 1.09 MtC (+0.2 MtC) of large fish, while only 0.13 MtC were removed from the ocean in 1950 (+0.02 MtC), equivalent to an increase of almost one order of magnitude in 65 years.
15. Among areas where blue carbon extraction occurs, 88.3% experienced an increase between 1950 and 2014 (Fig. 2A).
16. Marine regions with the highest increase in blue carbon extraction from fishing are located in the Western Pacific and around the equatorial strip (Fig. 2B).
17. In the early 1950s, blue carbon was mainly extracted in the Western Pacific and the Mediterranean Sea, while only 39% of ocean areas had reported extraction of large fish (Fig. 2C).
18. Despite the high economic cost of fishing in the high seas (14), there has been a progressive expansion of exploited areas, reaching 72% of the ocean surface by the early 2010s (Fig. 2D and fig.
19. Recent hotspots of blue carbon extraction are located near the coasts of East and Southeast Asia (both in Indian and Pacific Oceans), as well as in the western equatorial strip of the Pacific Ocean due to the development of tuna fisheries (Fig. 2D).
20. Considering that this blue carbon, expect bones, exported to land from the ocean through fisheries catches and landings is emitted as CO2 (3.75 MtCOz), combined with CO; emissions due to fuel consumption by the fishing fleets (16.6 MtCO3), a total of 20.4 MtCO were estimated to have been emitted in 2014.
21. This is equivalent to the annual emissions of 4.5 million cars, so 11.7% of the total number of cars registered in France or 0.05% of the global CO, emissions in 2014.
22. This also rep resents almost 17% of the decrease in CO) emission in Europe be tween January and April 2020 due to the corona virus disease 2019 forced confinement (~123 MtCO, less compared to the same period in 2019) (22).
23. The profitability of blue carbon extraction Reducing fisheries subsidies is being pursued as a policy to improve the ecological (23) and socioeconomic (14, 24) status of fisheries in the high seas (25).
24. To evaluate whether subsidies reduction policies also contribute to carbon mitigation, we analyze catches of large bodied fish from the high seas in 2014 and combine it with data on fisheries subsidies.
25. Specifically, on the basis of published data on the profitability of high-seas fisheries (14), we separate areas that are either estimated to be profitable or unprofitable to fish without sub sidies.
26. We estimate the proportion of blue carbon extracted from each of these areas relative to the total catches from the high seas.
27. Globally, 43.5% of the extracted blue carbon in the high seas comes from areas that would be unprofitable in the absence of subsidies (Fig. 3A).
28. These unprofitable fishing grounds include some areas with the highest amounts of blue carbon extracted (in red in Fig. 3, C and D).
29. These unprofitable and highly CO emitter areas are mainly located between 20°S and 10°N latitude and along the Japanese coasts, in Central Pacific, South Atlantic, and North Indian Oceans.
30. However, the proportion of unprofitable areas reduces to 23.1% if government subsidies are included (Fig. 3B).
31. Almost half of the areas that are estimated to emit carbon from fishing activities while being economically unprofitable become profitable with sub sidies.
32. This profitability shift of the main blue carbon extraction areas mainly occurs in the central Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (from red to yellow in Fig. 3, C and D).
33. Some areas would remain profit able to fish even without subsidies (blue cells in Fig.
34. 3C) because of lower costs of fishing that are dependent on the characteristics of the fisheries, e.g., ship size, gear type, and engine (14).

46. Rebuilding fish stocks as a NBS to climate change?
47. Limiting or preventing blue carbon extraction at least on the un profitable areas of the high seas while managing all fisheries to main tain the long-term viability and productivity of fish stocks would rebuild fish biomass and benefit carbon storage in three ways.
48. First, reducing overall fishing effort would lower CO; emissions by burn ing less fuel.
49. Second, rebuilding fish stocks would increase living biomass of large-bodied fish and thus promote the short-term carbon sequestration in the living compartment.
50. Third, more abun dant large-bodied fish would induce higher natural long-term carbon sequestration by increasing carcasses deadfall.
51. Previous studies evaluating the effectiveness, cobenefits, disbenefits, and governability of ocean solution to address climate change sug gest that eliminating overfishing and setting up marine-protected Mariani et al., Sci. Adv. 2020; 6: eabb4848 28 October 2020 areas can support climate adaptation (26).
52. Our findings further highlight the potential contributions of these interventions to climate mitigation through restoring blue carbon from eliminating over fishing in the high seas.
53. This is in addition to a wide range of other ecological and socioeconomic benefits of effective fisheries manage ment and spatial planning in the high seas, such as conserving bio diversity, reducing modern slavery in fisheries and inequalities between countries (14, 24, 27), improving the viability of small-scales fisheries (28), and, in general, achieving several sustainable develop ment goals (29-31).
54. Our analyses provide solid, yet conservative, estimates on how fisheries, mainly industrial, have affected blue carbon sequestration since 1950.
55. However, further studies are needed to provide compre hensive estimations of blue carbon potential from marine vertebrates and impacts of human activities on this sequestration pathway.
56. Par ticularly, we have only included fisheries targeting large-bodied fish in areas with a mean depth of more than 200 m and excluded up welling areas; thus, only 9.5% of the total catches in 2014 are considered 3 of 8 LZ0zg 'LE Aeyy uo /Bio

71. This means that we have likely underestimated not only the true role that marine vertebrates can have on carbon sequestration but also the impact of fisheries on this carbon seques tration.
72. We suggest that measures to rebuild fish stocks to sustainable level, e.g., biomass above maximum sustainable yield (MSY; >Bmsy) (37), could induce a much higher amount of carbon sequestered by large marine vertebrates, comparable to other coastal NBSs to cli mate change such as carbon mitigation potential of coastal wetland restoration (54 to 233 MtC per year) (38).
73. A broader range of NBS, including different scenarios of ocean management, can be explored to understand how blue carbon from marine vertebrates can be re stored and/or enhanced most effectively.
74. It is also important to consider the broader trade-offs of fish blue carbon-related NBSs with other society changes that aim to promote sustainable development.
75. For example, limiting catches of large pelagic species on the high seas might lead to substitution of sea food by other sources of proteins and nutrients with bigger environ mental and social footprints.
76. Particularly, the carbon footprint of products derived from marine fisheries and destined to human con sumption is much lower compared to other sources of animal protein (e.g., beef, lamb, and pork) (21).
77. A replacement of fish protein by livestock protein would promote carbon sequestration by unfished large pelagic species but would simultaneously increase CO emis sions from the agricultural sector.
78. However, given that many fish stocks are currently below their production potential because of overfishing (12), rebuilding overexploited fish stocks can ensure more sustainable seafood production, limiting the shift toward livestock protein while enhancing blue carbon sequestration with more large bodied fish and sinking carcasses.
