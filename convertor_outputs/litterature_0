19 : The general assertion is that increasing CO, has deleterious effects on the growth and productivity of marine calcifiers (e.g. Riebesell et al., 2000; DeLille et al., 2005; Orr et al., 2005), although there are notable exceptions (Langer et al., 2006).
19 : 4.2 Calcification  There has been shown to be a response to the saturation state of CaCO3 (Qearcite) in seawater and the growth and health of many calcifying marine organisms (e.g. Reibesell et al., 2000; Langdon et al., 2003; Kleypass et al., 2006; DeLille et al., 2005; Langer et al., 2006).
19 : Ocean nutrient stoichiometry is controlled on short timescales by the resource allocation in marine organisms (e.g. Redfield, 1958; Klausmeier et al., 2004) and on longer scales by continental nutrient supply (Broecker, 1982).
